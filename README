############User manual and installation guide################
Note: Please use Ubuntu 12.04 or lately.
      The shell script will install OCP checkbox automatically.

######[Download OCP C&I Server Certification Test Cases]######
$ git clone https://github.com/chilung/OCP_CI_Server_Certification_Test_Cases.git

######[Installation]######
$ sudo ./install.sh

######[Run Checkbox]######
$ sudo checkbox-ocp-cli -W [the path of whitelists]

Example: sudo checkbox-ocp-cli -W /usr/share/checkbox/data/whitelists/opencompute-certify-basic.whitelist

##############################################################################################
Before running ME/BMC test, please fill in related information in configuration file.
Each section exists in configuration file has its own purpose.
The following will explain how to fill in settings in each section.

Note:
1. Path of configuration file: /etc/checkbox.d/bmc.cfg or /etc/checkbox.d/me.cfg
2. Without these settings pre-setting in configuration file, you won't start tests smoothly.

############User manual of each section################

######[Targets]######
For remotely access via IPMI/DCMI, you need to fill in ME/BMC IP address of SUT.
For example, ME/BMC IP: 10.2.107.5
[Targets]
Target1: 10.2.107.5

######[Account]######
For remotely access via IPMI/DCMI, you need to fill in ME/BMC account here.
For example, USER/PASSWORD: OCP/OCP. Then, the settings in this section must be
[Account]
USER: OCP
PASSWORD: OCP

######[Sensors] and [SensorsForCPUTemp]######
For thermal tests of ME/BMC sensors, you need to check and set Sensor ID before starting tests.
Refers to TC-001-0006-Hardware_Monitoring.txt.in,
there are five kinds of sensors to monitor, so please write corresponding sensor ID to this field.
For example, the sensor ID related to these five kinds of sensors on Winterfell
are "outlet Temp", "inlet Temp", "PCH Temp", "P0 DIMM Temp", "P1 DIMM Temp", "P0 Therm Margin",
"P1 Therm Margin", "CPU0 Tjmax", "CPU1 Tjmax"
[Sensors]
Outlet: Outlet Temp
Inlet: Inlet Temp
PCH: PCH Temp
Px DIMM: P0 DIMM Temp
Py DIMM: P1 DIMM Temp
CPUx: CPU0 Temp
CPUy: CPU1 Temp

Note:
        Case1. There are CPU sensors to monitor CPU temperature directly.
               You just fill in sensor IDs behind key "CPUx" and "CPUy" and
               don't care the section [SensorsForCPUTemp] at all.
        Case2. There are no CPU sensors to monitor CPU temperature directly.
               CPUx temperature is derived from Px Therm Margin and CPUx Tjmax.
               ie,"CPU0 Temp" = "P0 Therm Margin" + "CPU0 Tjmax"
               (It still requires "PU0 Temp" marked behind key "CPUx")
               Besides, please also fill in "P0 Therm Margin", "PU0 Tjmax"
               to corresponding section presented as below.
               [SensorsForCPUTemp]
               Px Therm Margin: P0 Therm Margin
               Py Therm Margin: P1 Therm Margin
               CPUx Tjmax: CPU0 Tjmax
               CPUy Tjmax: CPU1 Tjmax


######[SensorsForSampling]######
Refers to test case TC-002-0008-001-Temp_Sampling_Increment, the description is to retrieve CPU and intake temperature 30 times.
For example, the related sensor IDs on Winterfell are "Inlet Temp", "P0 Therm Margin", "P1 Therm Margin", "CPU0 Tjmax", "CPU1 Tjmax".
[SensorsForSampling]
Inlet: Inlet Temp
CPUx: CPU0 Temp
CPUy: CPU1 Temp
Note: if the CPU0 temperature derives from "P0 therm Margin" and "CPU0 Tjmax",
you have to give a string "CPU0 temp" behind key "CPUx". And also remember to fill in the sensor ID in section [SensorsForCPUTemp].
Please refer to section [Sensors].
